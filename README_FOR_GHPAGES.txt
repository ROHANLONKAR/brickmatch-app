Quick deploy to GitHub Pages:

1) Create a public repo, e.g. brickmatch-app.
2) Upload index.html and data.csv to the repo root.
3) In Settings → Pages → Build and deployment:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main (or master) / root
4) Your site will be at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
5) To update data, edit data.csv in GitHub and commit.
6) Users can still press "Save to device" so it works offline.
